NBA Concessions Optimization EngineExecutive SummaryThis project creates an end-to-end simulation engine to optimize concession stand staffing at NBA arenas. By combining Machine Learning (for demand forecasting) with Queueing Theory (for operational simulation), the model solves the "Halftime Bottleneck"—predicting exactly how many staff members are needed to keep wait times under 5 minutes without over-spending on labor.The Business ProblemMacro Challenge: Predicting total inventory needs (e.g., "How many hot dogs do we prep?").Micro Challenge: Predicting queue dynamics (e.g., "How long is the line at 8:45 PM during halftime?").Goal: Minimize customer wait times while maximizing throughput.Technical ArchitectureThe solution is built in three distinct layers:1. Data Pipeline & Demand ForecastingData Source: Built a custom web scraper using BeautifulSoup to ingest the 2024 NBA Schedule (Dates, Teams, Venues, Attendance) directly from Basketball-Reference.Feature Engineering: Processed start times, weekend flags, and "Marquee Matchup" indicators.Forecasting: Trained a Random Forest Regressor ($R^2 = 0.86$) to predict total transaction volume based on attendance and game factors.2. Temporal ProfilingConverted total game demand into a time-decay curve.Modeled specific event spikes (e.g., the "Halftime Rush" where demand doubles for 15 minutes) to create a minute-by-minute arrival schedule.3. Discrete Event Simulation (The "Digital Twin")Developed a stochastic queueing simulator from scratch (Python).Modeled arrival rates ($\lambda$) and service rates ($\mu$) to simulate the physics of a waiting line.Applied Little’s Law ($L = \lambda W$) to derive accurate wait times from queue lengths.Tech StackLanguage: PythonData & ML: Pandas, Scikit-Learn (Random Forest), NumPyWeb Scraping: Requests, BeautifulSoupVisualization: Plotly (for interactive heatmaps and sensitivity analysis)Key Results & InsightsThe "Death Spiral" Identified: The simulation revealed that staffing below 3 servers during halftime causes queue lengths to grow asymptotically (infinite wait times).The Optimal Operating Point: identified an "elbow" in the efficiency curve at 5-6 servers, where wait times drop to <5 minutes. Adding staff beyond this point yields diminishing returns on ROI.
